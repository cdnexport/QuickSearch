# QuickTube
QuickTube is a browser extension that allows users to quickly open the first YouTube search result for highlighted text.

## ToDo
* Port extension to Firefox. (Currently only chrome is supported)
* Add options page with:
  * QuickTube will open the top search result in a new tab.
  * QuickTube will open the YouTube search results in a new tab.
* It is currently very slow. Likely because of it's use of XMLHTTPRequest. Investigate if the features can be replaced with the Google API.
* Add ESLint.
